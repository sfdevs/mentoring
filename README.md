# Mentoring

The goal of this project is to provide a place for new developers to get feedback on their project from someone with work experience. This will help bring the mentee up as well as spread the knowledge from the mentor. This shouldn't focus on 1-1 time but rather code review and feature suggestions.

## How it works in a perfect world

1. The mentee will devote some time to learning, This should be some what scheduled. We all know how easy it is to stop when you've fallen off the horse.
1. The mentee will have a project idea or existing project to work on.
1. The mentee will work on the project and when questions arise, the appropriate files/links will be sent to the mentor (in an issue on their github project page). 
1. The mentor will help resolve the issues.
1. If the mentee gets stuck, the mentor will open "feature request" style tickets on the repo to encourage more progress. 

# Looking for Menntor

If you are looking for a mentor. Please post an issue with the tag `Looking-For-Mentor`. Please post what tech stack you are interested in learning. Be as vague or accurate as you feel fits. If you have an existing project please post a link to that. 

# Available Mentor

If you are a mentor interested in guiding a young mind to love your tech stack under the tag `Mentor`. Please post a little bit about it, and any special requirements it may have (IE, iOS development requires a Mac) 

# Code Reviews

If you're not interested in a commitment, code reviews are always an amazing part of learning. Create an issue with the tag `Code-Review` and people who are available will try to review it. (Please use github for the sake of everyone's time) This will get many eyes on your project and help you see bugs you may not have noticed, etc etc.
